Caps Word feature doesn't seem to work on macOS? Problem with "weak mods"? Not sure this will help, but I can add caps word state to the SYS output, from is_caps_word_on().


Proposed changes:
* Make the symbols layer non-lockable. Drop the JKC_SYM keycode and just use MO(_SYMBOLS). Frees up the blue LED.
* Make the up/down left hand keys do home/end on the symbols layer.
* DYNAMIC_MACRO_ENABLE = yes in rules.mk. Also maybe make a config.h with DYNAMIC_MACRO_NO_NESTING defined?
* Current "left" key in thumb cluster becomes DM_PLY1. On symbols layer, DM_REC1.
* Current "right" key in thumb cluster becomes DM_PLY2. On symbols layer, DM_REC2.
* Add user hooks to light the blue LED during macro recording/playback; see https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/feature_dynamic_macros.md
* On symbols layer change the enter key doing KC_MPLY so it does KC_MPRV instead.
* On symbols layer, the normal bracket keys can be KC_PSCR and KC_INS.
* On symbols layer, block the normal right-column tick and backslash keys with KC_NO.
* On mousenum layer, block out (KC_NO) the caps-word, up, and down keys.
* On mousenum layer, make the caps-word key do alt-backtick and the tab key do alt-tab; method as per https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/feature_macros.md#super-alttab except can also unregister alt as soon as the symbols layer is deactivated, i.e the code that checks timer can also check IS_LAYER_OFF(_SYMBOLS).

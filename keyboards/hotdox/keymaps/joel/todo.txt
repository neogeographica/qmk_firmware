Alt-backtick/tilde for cycling app windows is awkward now. Possible solutions:

- Make the lower-left key act as backtick/tilde if alt is held.

- Make the lower-left key normally act as backtick/tilde. Make the capsword feature available with a modifier ... maybe put it on layer 1? Or if key is combo'd with shift?

- Make the lower-left key just be backtick/tilde. Either drop the capsword feature or make it activate-able with shift double tap (#define DOUBLE_TAP_SHIFT_TURNS_ON_CAPS_WORD). This seems best?

In the latter two cases, probably replace the keycap.

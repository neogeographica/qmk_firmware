Caps Lock key doesn't work in the symbols/special layer. Thinking it might be because releasing the layer clears the capslock state maybe? On the other hand an online key tester seems to indicate that it's just sending a Ctrl key event. I never use caps lock so maybe the best "solution" is just to find something else to put on that key.

Also... Caps Word feature doesn't seem to work on macOS?
